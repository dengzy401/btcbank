I managed to build the XPM Reaper on Ubuntu 13.04 server:

First! Redownload the miner from the link I gave you. There should be a VERSION file that says it's beta 2.

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgmp-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev dh-autoreconf pkg-config libjansson-dev
download & install AMD's (or Nvidia's) OpenCL SDK

download bitcoin-libblkmaker from 
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55025350/bitcoin-libblkmaker.zip
and save it to the directory where the miner sources are.
then do this in the same dir:
{
	unzip bitcoin-libblkmaker.zip
	cd libblkmaker
	make clean
	./autogen.sh
	make
	sudo make install
	cd ..
}

Then, run cmake-linux.sh
If you have problems compiling, please post to the bitcointalk thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=273637.0
